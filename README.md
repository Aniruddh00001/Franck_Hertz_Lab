# Franck_Hertz_Lab
The data collected in this experiment and all calculations, graphs, and tables shown in my Franck-Hertz lab report are available here.

The file "franck_hertz.ipynb" contains all graphs and analysis for the lab. The files "franck_hertz_data.txt" and "franck_hertz_data_2.txt" contain the raw data collected during the experiment. The file "franck_hertz_data.txt" contains the voltage-current measurements for E1 = 6.180, E2 = 3.022, and "franck_hertz_data_2.txt" contains the voltage-current measurements for E1 = 5.000, E2 = 1.022.
